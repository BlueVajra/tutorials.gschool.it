* Test First Programming

## Tech skill learned

* Ruby basics
* Running acceptance tests

## Resources

**Warning: Some of the online material may not be compatible with your version of Ruby but it is free.**

* Online Materials
    * [Learn to Program Website](){:target="_blank"}
    * [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](){:target="_blank"} - when you read "function" substitute the word "method"

## Homework - not complete

1. Go through [https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/){:target="_blank"} to learn about irb and running ruby from command line. <a name="irb"></a>

1. Complete assignments below by getting the tests to pass <a name="programs"></a>

Each item below should be implemented in a file that is named after the title of the item using proper Ruby file naming conventions. If you
get stuck on one, write as much code as you can then write out your logic using comments and short English phrases for any code that you do not know how to write.
When you are done, push your code to a [new GitHub repository](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo){:target="_blank"}.

1. Greetings
    1. The program asks a user for their name by printing the prompt "Please enter your name:".
    1. The program prints out the text "Hello <enteredName>!" where <enteredName> is replaced by the
    name entered above.

1. Guessing Game
    1. The program calculates a random number between 1 and 10 when it starts and stores it in a variable.
    1. The program asks the user for a number by printing the prompt "Please enter a number:".
    1. If that number is less than the random number, print out the string "Higher" and asks for another number
    1. If that number is greater than the random number, print out the string "Lower" and asks for another number.
    1. If that number is equal to the random number, print out "Congratulations!" and stop asking for numbers.
