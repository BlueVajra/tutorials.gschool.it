# Setting up Rubymine for Awesomeness

## Goal
At the end of this demo, you should be able to do the following things without a mouse:

* run ruby files
* open files
* be able to move the cursor to a specific line
* switch between test files and implementation files

## Understanding Why

Being able to navigate files and run code without using the mouse saves time, because your hands don't have
to constantly leave the home row and move to the mouse.

## Tab Sizes

By default, when you type TAB, Rubymine inserts spaces.  This is good, but sometimes it inserts too many spaces.

In this section, you'll set all your TAB sizes to be 2 spaces:

### Javascript

### Ruby

### SASS

### SCSS

## Appearance

Show all line numbers:

## File Navigation

Tell Rubymine to:
* Open files when you click them once in the sidebar
* Sync the file inspector on the left side whenever you navigate to a file

## Change the Ruby SDK

You may have several different Ruby versions on your system.  You can easily tell Rubymine which version
of Ruby you'd like to use.

When you change your Ruby SDK, Rubymine sometimes takes a minute to re-index the new Ruby files.

## Keep more items on your clipboard

When you copy or cut something to your clipboard, Rubymine doesn't just remember the last thing you copied / pasted,
it remembers several.  By default this limit is 5, but you can easily increase it:

## Editor Tabs

When you open multiple files in Rubymine, they open in tabs.  By default, if you have lots of files open, it displays
those tabs in multiple rows, which takes away valuable space from your editor.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

In Rubymine you can access every feature with the mouse, either through the menus, by right-clicking or by clicking
 on small visual prompts.  But you can also access all of these features through keyboard shortcuts.  Here are a few
 of the most important shortcuts you'll use when writing code at gSchool:

### Navigate to a file

### View recently opened files

### Format code

When you are writing code, you might find yourself spending a lot of time putting code at the correct indentation level.
Rubymine has a way to do that for you using OPTION + COMMAND + L:

### Running Ruby Files / Tests / Specs

You can run Ruby files by typing CONTROL + SHIFT + R

When you run specs or tests, you get nice output with a red / green progress bar:

And all of these run commands are available through the Run menu.
