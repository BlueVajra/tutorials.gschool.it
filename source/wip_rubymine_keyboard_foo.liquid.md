# Increasing your RubyMine keyboard foo

## Goal
At the end of this demo, you should be able to do the following things without a mouse:

* run ruby files
* open files
* be able to move the cursor to a specific line
* switch between test files and implementation files

## Understanding Why

Being able to control your IDE/editor without using the mouse saves time, because your hands don't have
to constantly leave the home row, move to the mouse and return to the home row to type code. RubyMine has a
ton of keyboard shortcut

## Keyboard Shortcuts

In Rubymine you can access every feature with the mouse, either through the menus, by right-clicking or by clicking
 on small visual prompts.  But you can also access all of these features through keyboard shortcuts.  Here are a few
 of the most important shortcuts you'll use when writing code at gSchool:

### Navigate to a file

### View recently opened files

### Format code

When you are writing code, you might find yourself spending a lot of time putting code at the correct indentation level.
Rubymine has a way to do that for you using OPTION + COMMAND + L:

### Running Ruby Files / Tests / Specs

You can run Ruby files by typing CONTROL + SHIFT + R

When you run specs or tests, you get nice output with a red / green progress bar:

And all of these run commands are available through the Run menu.
