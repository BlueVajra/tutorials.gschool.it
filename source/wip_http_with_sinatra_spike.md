## Goals

A student should be able to:

* Understand what a 'spike' is and why they are useful in software development
* Be able to define Sinatra routes, with the proper HTTP verb, for different endpoints
* Understand concept of localhost and a hosts file

## XP practices learned

* Spikes
* Baby steps

## Tech skills learned

* Sinatra
* HTTP
* [eRb templates](http://www.stuartellis.eu/articles/erb/){:target="_blank"}
* [Ruby heredocs](http://blog.jayfields.com/2006/12/ruby-multiline-strings-here-doc-or.html){:target="_blank"}

## Spiking

* Research/understanding
    * Starts with a specific question/hypothesis
    * End with an answer/data to above
* No tests
* [Timeboxed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing){:target="_blank"}
* Throw away code
    * The deliverable is the knowledge gained, not production code
    * Implementing production tests/code will now go faster

## Demo

* Implement an endpoint '/' that displays a page with a message to the user and a link to the items page found at '/items'.

* Implement the '/items ' endpoint that displays a web page with a list of 3 menu items on it. Each item displays a title.

## Homework

1. Read the [Sinatra introduction](http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html){:target="_blank"}. Make notes of what makes sense and what doesn't make sense.

1. Implement solutions to the following exercises. You should create a new, well named directory in your gSchool working directory and initialize a
Git repository there. You should also create a GitHub repository and push all changes to that repository.

    * Endpoint 1
    * Endpoint 2
    * Endpoint 3
    * Endpoint 4
